# Polls Smart Contract
This is a polls smart contract written for the Terra blockchain. It is a practice project to familiarize myself with writing Smart Contracts.

#### A quick note:
I made the decision to store the question & poll options on-chain with this contract. I made this decision because I thought it would provide good additional practice, but if I were writing this for production use I would consider storing this data off-chain to reduce the amount of storage required by the contract.
